### Core Concepts
Core concepts was mostly lectures and quizzes.  There is a wealth of info in this section that I didn't list here.

Some key learnings in this section:
- etcd
- crictl and containerd
- Labels & Selectors
- Compute Quotas
- A <i>much</i> better understanding of Services
- Code has a kubernetes extension - and it's f* awesome

Included here are some yamls I built along the way. Except for c0_namespace they can be run in any order.
